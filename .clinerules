# INSTRUCTIONS

- Use primereact, axios, primeflex, react-hot-toast.
- Don't use third party packages, just when I tell you to use them
- Don't install plugins just tell me what we need to install and I will install it manually
- Make sure to optimize UI UX
- Don't use Card component instead use the className `card`
- Don't use the primereact toast component.
- In layout always use grid if possible from primeflex
